# ChilloutVR Mods

This repo contains all my mods for ChilloutVR. There's only one mod here currently, but I hope that more will arrive or else it was somewhat pointless to create a repository called "mods".

## Mods

### [MenuReRender](MenuReRender/README.md)
This is a BepInEx mod that renders the menu and the quickmenu on top of the screen after everything else, making it virtually impossible (at least to my knowledge) for people to block your access to the menu. This mod is currently limited to desktop users.

## Installing
Drag the dll's for the mods you want into the `ChilloutVR/BepInEx/plugins` folder.

## Disclaimer
Neither I nor these mods are in any way affiliated with Alpha Blend Interactive and/or ChilloutVR. Using these modifications might cause issues with the performance, security or stability of the game. Use at your own risk.
