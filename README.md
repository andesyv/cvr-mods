# ChilloutVR Mods

This repo contains all my mods for ChilloutVR. All the mods presented uses [BepInEx 6](https://docs.bepinex.dev/master/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html).

## Mods

### [MenuReRender](src/MenuReRender/README.md)
This is a BepInEx mod that renders the menu and the quickmenu on top of the screen after everything else, making it virtually impossible (at least to my knowledge) for people to block your access to the menu. This mod is currently limited to desktop users.

### [StickyMenu](src/StickyMenu/README.md)
A small ChilloutVR mod that makes the main menu follow your view. It also enables you to grab the main menu as a prop and position
it around in space.

**Note:** Currently the rotation is a bit wonky and I also have not confirmed that it works on the current version of the game so stuff might be broken.

## Installing
Drag the dll's for the mods you want into the `ChilloutVR/BepInEx/plugins` folder.

## Disclaimer
Neither I nor these mods are in any way affiliated with Alpha Blend Interactive and/or ChilloutVR. Using these modifications might cause issues with the performance, security or stability of the game. Use at your own risk.
