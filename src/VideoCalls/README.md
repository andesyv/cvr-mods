# VideoCalls
Records a camera projection of yourself and then passes it to another player to be displayed on their end, and vice versa. Initially made simple using the mod-network.

## Possible future extensions:
 - Records 2 camera projections (stereoscopic) to display a 3D image
 - Projects the image on your arm in a "holographic" style
 - Pass images across instances by using an intermediate server
   - Using a tiny containerized server app
